A funny project to create eyes that follow the mouse's movement

![FollowingEye.gif](./FollowingEye.gif)

What is being **used** in this project:
- **Object Factory** to create the following eyes
- **DOM** to interact and modify easily the browser's content
- **Events** specifically the onmousemove event to follow the movement

## How to use

1. Push the **"Add"** button to add a new Eye that will follow you.
2. Push the **"Remove"** button remove a Following Eye.

## Improvements to come

- **Buttons and fields** to change the number of eyes from the browser
- **Eye sensitivity** improvements, for better mouse tracking
